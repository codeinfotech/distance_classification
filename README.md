Concise Summary of Findings and Learnings from the Project

The project succeeded in classifying faces into two groups with the detection of faces using a Haar Cascade classifier on grayscale images from which average hue and saturation features in HSV color space extracted K-Means clustering whose results were visualized via scatterplot with centroids. The excellent reproducible and efficient work offered in this project relied on such tools as WandB, GitHub, and Docker for experiment tracking, version control, and containerization, respectively. This showed thus the efficiency of the method for face category classification, which powerfully combined image processing with clustering techniques.
